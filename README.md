This project proposes the development of an Advanced Facial Recognition and Anti-Spoofing System that leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for face recognition and anti-spoofing. The system aims to enhance security, accuracy and robustness in biometric authentication by detecting and preventing spoofing attacks. The proposal integrates insights from recent research reviews on face recognition technology, face anti-spoofing methods, and neural network-based face detection. The project will contribute to advancing the field of biometric authentication systems and addressing the challenges posed by spoofing attacks.
The project aims to develop an Advanced Facial Recognition and Anti-Spoofing System that enhances security and accuracy in biometric authentication. The system will leverage deep learning techniques for face recognition and anti-spoofing, addressing the vulnerabilities of traditional face recognition systems to spoofing attacks. The proposal outlines the objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes of the project.
